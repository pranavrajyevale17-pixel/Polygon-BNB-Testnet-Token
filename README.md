ðŸ“Œ Overview

In this task, the goal is to create a custom ERC-20 or BEP-20 token using Solidity and deploy it for free on blockchain testnets like Polygon Mumbai or BNB Chain Testnet.

ðŸ›  Skills Gained

Smart contract development

Blockchain deployment

MetaMask integration

GitHub portfolio building

ðŸ§° Tools Used

Remix IDE â€“ Write and deploy Solidity contracts

MetaMask â€“ Wallet and testnet integration

OpenZeppelin Contracts â€“ Standard token templates

Polygon Faucet â€“ Free MATIC test tokens

BNB Faucet â€“ Free BNB testnet tokens

ðŸš€ Steps to Complete

Open Remix IDE and create a new Solidity contract.

Use OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract template.

Compile and deploy on Polygon Mumbai or BNB Testnet using MetaMask.

Fund your wallet with test tokens from the faucet.

Verify your contract on PolygonScan or BscScan Testnet.

Upload your smart contract code, screenshots, and explorer link to this repository.
